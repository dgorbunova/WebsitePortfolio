            <h3>Robotics Experience University of Bath</h3>
                <p class="titillium-web-regular">
                    For my work experience I completed a supervised Robotics Project at the University of Bath. It was an individual 5 day experience, during which I got to work with programming a robotics arm to perform a series of tasks. I was able to learn how to use Python to program the arm, and how to use the arm to perform tasks such as picking up objects and moving them to a different location. By the end of the project I presented my findings to my supervisor, by which point I had was able to use 3D printed blocks, which the robot arm used to build a Pike Loop wall.

                <h3>Group leader for technical crew in a production </h3>
                <p class="titillium-web-regular">
                    I worked as lead designed and technician for the technical crew for a production of "Antigone" and "Little Shop of Horrors" at Kingswood School. I was responsible for the lighting design and programming, as well as the rigging and electrical aspects of the production. I was also responsible for the safety of the crew and the actors, and for ensuring that the production ran smoothly. This has taught me the importance of good leaderhip and communication skills, as well as the importance of being able to work under pressure.

                <h3>Virtual Experience in HTML and CSS</h3>
                <p class="titillium-web-regular">
                    I completed a virtual experience course in HTML and CSS. This showed me the importance of planning, creating web and user flow charts, and how to use HTML forms and CSS. I was given a task to ensure I understood those basics, and received a certificate of completion. This experience has given me a good understanding of how to create a website, and how to use HTML and CSS to create a website that is both functional and visually appealing.

                    I attented an AI and Big Data Expo Global in London in October 2023. The event featured a distinguished line-up of speakers who provided insights into the impact of artificial intelligence. The speakers outlined a comprehensive picture of AI as a force for positive change, touching on aspects of storytelling, education, regulation, and collaborative initiatives. Their insights collectively showcased the potential of AI to assist in a transformative era, enhancing human experiences
